Based on the overview of how [to potentially model data citation in JATS](https://github.com/data-citation-working-group/data-citation-workshop-2014/blob/master/data-citation-to-JATS-mapping-v1.md) a number of tag 
additions/modifications are explicity suggested. 

These are

- addition of a `<version>` element 
- addition of a `<data-format>` element
- extension of `<pub-id>` to take an `xlink` attribute
- addition of an `@institution-wrap` attribute
